****** NUT Nutrition Software ******
Thanks to the good graces of [Get_NUT_Nutrition_Software_at_SourceForge.net.
Fast,_secure_and_Free_Open_Source_software], I now have my very own
web page. Isn't it hip.
I have written open-source free nutrition software, NUT, which records what you
eat and analyzes your meals for nutrient levels in terms of the "Daily Value"
or DV which is the standard for food labeling in the US. The program uses the
free_food_composition_database from the USDA. This free nutritional analysis
software was written for Unix systems (I use Slackware_Linux), but can be
compiled on just about any system with a C compiler. (To get a free C compiler,
Windows people might look at Cygwin or MinGW, and Mac people might look at
xcode.) By experimenting with NUT, you can find the optimal level of the
various nutrients and how to implement this with foods available to you. NUT
can help reconstruct the lost instruction manual to your care and feeding
because, when the authorities and crackpots disagree on the proper human diet,
you can design an experiment using the food composition tables to discover the
truth!
Features of NUT include:
    * 7906 foods and 146 nutrients--the complete, latest USDA database
    * Foods easy to find and add to daily meals
    * Configurable for 1-19 meals per day and any dietary plan--including low
      carb, zone, low fat
    * Comprehensive meal analysis for any number of consecutive meals
    * Presents both easy-to-read percentage summaries and in-depth nutrient
      analysis, including Omega-3 and Omega-6 essential fatty acids
    * Defaults to ounces or grams based on user input
    * Suggests foods based on current diet
    * Includes novel meal planning feature: you choose the food, NUT adjusts
      the quantities to your plan
    * Can easily create additional databases for other family members
    * Auto-transfer of successful dietary strategies from analysis screen to
      configuration settings
    * Allows recording of recipes and customary meals for fast data entry
    * Guesses recipes of packaged foods
    * Creates graphs of nutrient intake showing daily and monthly trends
    * Sorts foods richest in each of the 146 nutrients
    * Reveals which foods contribute most to user's nutrition
    * Runs on Linux and just about everything else that can compile a C
      program, and NUT has no dependencies on other programs. It runs fast and
      it's not huge.
    * The price is right--it's free! And you can read and modify the source
      code.
ATTN Ubuntu users: the console version of NUT runs when invoked in a terminal,
so if you installed the Ubuntu/Debian version, then open up an xterm or other
terminal and type "nut-nutrition". If their version doesn't work for you, take
the latest version from here and compile NUT yourself--it's not hard to do.
Just read the README, and if you don't get it, send me an email telling me what
you don't understand and I'll help you with it. For the GUI version, install
both the "fltk" and "fltk-dev" packages before compiling NUT if you don't
compile FLTK from source.

This release includes two versions of the program: the usual console program
and a C++/FLTK-based GUI. The graphical user interface version retains the
essential program functions and the same general layout, although the
connections between the program functions are made synchronous and explicit in
the GUI. Both the console program and the GUI operate identically on the
underlying database.
Prior to installing NUT, install fltk-1.1.10, but NUT does not work with the
so-called "stable" fltk-1.3.0, although it works with some 1.3 betas. You may
use the console and GUI versions interchangeably, but not at the same time
because they would overwrite each other's changes to the database just as two
instances of the console program would; although the problem is made worse
because the GUI saves its state much more often and a change to anything in the
GUI is a change to just about everything in the GUI.
The GUI is not resizable; however, if you edit the "fontsize" file in the
.nutdb directory, the next time the GUI comes up it will size itself
proportionally to the new font size in pixels. The range is 8 to 24; the
default is 12.
