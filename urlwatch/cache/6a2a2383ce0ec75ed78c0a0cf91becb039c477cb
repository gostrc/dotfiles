****** mlpy - Machine Learning Python ******
===============================================================================
mlpy is a Python module for Machine Learning built on top of NumPy/SciPy and
the GNU_Scientific_Libraries.
mlpy provides a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning methods for
supervised and unsupervised problems and it is aimed at finding a reasonable
compromise among modularity, maintainability, reproducibility, usability and
efficiency. mlpy is multiplatform, it works with Python 2 and 3 and it is Open
Source, distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.
